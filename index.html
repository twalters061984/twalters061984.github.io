                <h1>In West Philadelphia born and raised...</h1>
                <p>Technically I was born in Florida but it's so much more fun to start off with that line. I was born in Florida however the majority of my life was spent in the Tri-State area with the majority of my time in the Philadelphia area.</p>

                    <span>But what about the roads?</span>
                    You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't worry kiddo, where there's a demand there will be a supply; we'll all have our roads.

                    <span>Is taxation theft?</span>
                    If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>So, what you're saying is...?</span>
                    Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons.A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.
